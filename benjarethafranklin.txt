There's an old friend
That I once heard say
Something that touched my heart
And it began this way

I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been runnin' ever since
He said it's been a long time comin'
But I know my change is gonna come
Oh yeah

He said it's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
I might not be if I knew
What was up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time comin'
But I know my change has got to come
Oh yeah

I went, I went to my brother
And I asked him, "Brother
Could you help me, please?"
He said, "Good sister
I'd like to but I'm not able"
And when I, when I looked around
I was right back down
Down on my bended knees
Yes I was, oh

There I've been times that I thought
I thought that I wouldn't last for long
But somehow right now I believe
That I'm able, I'm able to carry on
I tell you that it's been along
And oh it's been an uphill journey
All the way
But I know, I know, I know
I know my change is gonna come
Sometimes I had to cry all night long
Yes I did
Sometimes I had to give up right
For what I knew was wrong
Yes it's been an uphill journey
It's sure's been a long way comin'
Yes it has
It's been real hard
Every step of the way
But I believe, I believe
This evenin' my change is come
Yeah I tell you that
My change is come
